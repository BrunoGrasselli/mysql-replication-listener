Dependencies
------------

To be able to run the unit tests, you have to have Google Test
installed. Google Test will be automatically installed if cmake is
called as:

   cmake -DENABLE_DOWNLOADS=1 .


Building
--------

To build the entire package, it is first necessary to run CMake to build all the makefiles.

        cmake .

Some of the examples are using third-party software, which can require
extra parameters to be given to CMake.


Building with CLucene
---------------------

To build the mysql2lucene example, it is necessary to ensure that the
'FindCLucene.cmake' is in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, which on my machine
require me to write:

    cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH:String=/usr/share/kde4/apps/cmake/modules .

In addition, there is a bug in the packaging of CLucene on Ubuntu in
that the 'clucene-config.h' file is placed in '/usr/lib/CLucene' but
not in '/usr/include/CLucene', causing compiler failure when
attempting to use CLucene. The 'CMakeLists.txt' file hacks around this
by adding the libraries explicitly, but it seems unnecessary.
